% 1. explicar a importancia de jogos para crianças cegas
% pessoas cegas
According to the ``Disability Overview'' of the World Bank \cite{theworldbank2016}, one billion people, or 15\% of the world’s population, experience some form of disability. 
%In addition, the overview shows that one-fifth of the estimated global total, or between 110 million and 190 million people, experience significant disabilities.


% crianças cegas
The last report of ``World Health Organization''\cite{visualimpairmentandblindness_2014}, in 2014,  says 285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide, of which 39 million are blind. About 90\% of the world's visually impaired live in low-income settings. Furthermore, of this total amount, an estimated 19 million children under age 15 are visually impaired. Of these, 1.4 million are irreversibly blind for the rest of their lives and need visual rehabilitation interventions for a full psychological and personal development. 
%82\% of people living with blindness are aged 50 and above. Globally, uncorrected refractive errors are the main cause of moderate and severe visual impairment; cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness in middle- and low-income countries. The number of people visually impaired from infectious diseases has reduced in the last 20 years according to global estimates work. 80\% of all visual impairment can be prevented or cured.


% dificuldades de crianças cegas no aprendizado
In the face of this amount, the blind children education has to take into account in the studies to provide a school integration and social inclusion \cite{Sanchez2008}. Visual impairment has a significant impact on individuals’ quality of life, including their ability to work and to develop personal relationships \cite{city11930}.


New technologies have been developed to help blind children, as assistive technology, that has a significant role for them \cite{assistivetechnology}. Assistive technology services may include seating and mobility, augmentative and alternative communication, job accommodation or worksite modification, computer access, tools to aid activities of daily living, etc \cite{assistivetechnology2}.
%which has been standardized in several studies


% usando tecnologia!!
Research supports the notion that technology has to be present in the student learning activities \cite{mandell2002tips} \cite{crane2005teacher}. On-going advances in information technology (IT) are increasing the scope for IT-based mobile assistive technologies \cite{city11930}, that are an option to facilitate the independence, safety, and improved quality of visually impaired life.


In this IT-based area, the serious games have been explored as attractive tools for achieving this goal and helping people with visual disabilities to perceive and to interpret the surrounding world \cite{sanchez2015multimodal} \cite{Yuan2008}. With a serious focus, the video game could stimulate and develop various abilities in people with visual impairment. 
%There are several different experiences with the design and use of video games for stimulating the development of various abilities in people with visual impairment (Yuan, 2009; Yuan & Folmer, 2008).

% falar que existem mts jogos para crianças cegas
As shown in the mapping study \cite{Sanchez2015}, there are many serious games and virtual environments designed for stimulating the development of various abilities in people with visual impairment. In general, these video games combine different sources of perceptual inputs, as audio and haptics, making us consider the games as "multimodal serious video games". 


% 2. mostrar a importancia em se verificar o impacto
Concern about the impact, assistive technologies for persons with disabilities, as multimodal serious video games, generally employs evidence-based practice (EBP). The EBP meets prescribed criteria related to the research design, quality, quantity, and effect size of supporting research \cite{assistivetechnology} \cite{assistivetechnology2}. As a solution, \textbf{impact evaluation} applies a rigorous and empirical evidence to assure the quality of an IT-based  assistive technology with enhancement purposes, as explained in \cite{darin2015dimensions} with cognitive impact evaluation.



%occurs by using the  \cite{assistivetechnology} , that  
%citing the importance of acquiring rigorous, empirical evidence to inform instructional practice
%Research reveals models of usability for assistive technology in various settings that can be employed to gather evidence.\cite{assistivetechnology}
% The No Child Left Behind Act requires, however, the use of evidencebased practices based on scientific evidence (Odom et al., 2005). Scientific evidence is empirical evidence; evidence that can be measured, organized, and understood through a specific hierarchy of rigor.

%It is important to point out that both evaluations are necessary to assure the quality of multimodal video games with cognitive enhancement purposes. According to the ISO/IEC 9126 (2001) quality, relates to "[...] all the features of a product or service that exert their abilities to meet the stated or involved needs." It makes clear that usability is an important aspect of the game’s quality. However, without a proper cognitive impact evaluation ofe cannot assure that a particular application can develop or enhance any cognitive skills for people with visual disabilities [27].\cite{darin2015dimensions}


Effective impact evaluation should, therefore, be able to assess precisely the mechanisms by which people with visual disabilities are developing or enhancing any skills, e.g. cognitive skills \cite{darin2015dimensions}. The impact evaluation help understands if the intended effects were achieved \cite{khandker2009handbook}. Figure \ref{fig:impact} shows an estimated impact example applied for an economic program.

%Evaluated we could evaluate the impact of a multimodal serious game  could  To measure the impact of a technologie, 
Despite the importance of impact evaluation, Sánchez et al.(2015) \cite{Sanchez2015} shows the cognitive impact evaluation is the second most frequent type of end quality assessment for multimodal video games (50\% among the applications analyzed), performed less often than usability evaluation  (64\% among the applications analyzed). Others types of impact evaluations are not mentioned because there are not broadly applied. The problem when realizing this is: \textit{(i)} how to confirm if the multimodal interfaces are appropriate for cognitive development of people with visual disabilities; and \textit{(i)} how to trust a technology that lacks scientific rigor to assure their quality. 

%Problem: 
% confirmar com pesquisa itens abaixo:
% é necessário analisar como o impacto é avaliado em sistemas com interfaces multimodais para pessoas cegas, não há muita pesquisa sobre isso. (gaps encontrados)

In the face of this issue, the overall goal of this study is \textbf{to analyze how is the impact evaluated on systems for people with visual impairment, considering these systems based on multimodal interfaces}. These systems could be mobile applications, computer software, IoT systems among others. We focus on video games, but to augmented our knowledge on how the impact evaluation is applied, we deal with applications and systems with or without gamification. To achieve the primary goal, we establish the next secondary goals.

\begin{itemize}
    \item To verify if the impact evaluated after designing and developing multimodal systems for people who are blind, and how it is applied;
    \item To find the most frequently used impact evaluation methods on multimodal interfaces for people who are blind, looking out for their study context areas.
    \item To determine how the blindness is studied in many study context disciplines
    \item To check in which study context disciplines the impact evaluation methods are applied.
    \item To know the types of evaluation impact is addressed.
\end{itemize}



% 4. um dos intuitos do mapeamento é verificar se estes trabalhos utilizam outro tipo de impacto / quais tipos

In this context, to summarize the existing evidence concerning the impact evaluation of multimodal systems, also to summarize the empirical evidence of the benefits and limitations of a specific evaluation, we will apply a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)~\cite{keele2007guidelines}. In contrast to an ad hoc literature review, an SLR is a methodologically rigorous review of research results. Also, we aim to identify any gaps in current research to suggest areas for further investigation. Until now, this area is a research gap, and it will be endorsed by the SLR.

This document is a protocol specifies the research question being addressed and the methods that will be used to perform the review.
